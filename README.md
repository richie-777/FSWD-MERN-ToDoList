# FSWD-MERN-ToDoList

This is a simple Todo application with a separate frontend and backend. The frontend is built with React, and the backend is built with Node.js and Express.

Installation
To install the application, clone this repository and navigate to the root directory. Then, install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

bash
# Install dependencies for frontend
cd frontend

npm install

# Install dependencies for backend
cd ../backend

npm install


# Usage
To run the application, start both the frontend and backend servers:

bash
# Start frontend server
cd frontend

npm start

# Start backend server
cd ../backend

npm start

Once both servers are running, you can access the Todo application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
